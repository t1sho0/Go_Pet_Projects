# My Go Learning Projects

## About Me
 Hi! I'm Abdurashid, a developer passionately learning the Go programming language. This repository is my playground for experimenting, building small projects, and sharpening my skills. Here you'll find my learning subprojects that help me dive deeper into Go and tackle real-world problems.

## About the Projects
This repository contains subprojects I've worked on and continue to develop while learning Go. Each project is a step toward mastering the language's fundamentals, interfaces, structs, concurrency, and other features. Here are some tasks I've implemented:  
- **Contract**: A program to generate contract text with calculated signing date and payment amounts.  
- **Chalkboard Queue**: An electronic queue system for students with input handling and commands.  
- **Programmer Arseny**: A set of functions for handling dates and times, including determining the day of the week and time of day.  
- **Text Analyzer**: A program to analyze text, counting words and listing the top-5 most frequent words.  
- **Virtual Zoo**: An OOP-based application for managing virtual animals.

## Technologies 
- **Language**: Go (Golang)  
- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code, Go Modules, Git  
- **Libraries**: Standard Go library (`time`, `unicode/utf8`, etc.)

## How to Run the Projects  
1. Install Go:  
   - Download and install Go from the [official website](https://go.dev/dl/).  
   - Ensure the `GOPATH` environment variable is set.  
2. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/t1sho0/Go_Pet_Projects.git
   cd Go_Pet_Projects
   ```  
3. Run a project:  
   - Navigate to the subproject folder (e.g., `cd level_0`) and run:  
     ```bash
     go run main.go
     ```

## Future Plans
I'm continuing to learn Go and plan to:  
- Add projects involving concurrency and network programming.  
- Build REST APIs with Go.  
- Improve code quality by following Go best practices.
